## Indian Trade Analysis
This project involves studying the patterns and trends in India's domestic and international trade, including the country's imports and exports of goods and services. This could involve analyzing data on trade volumes, the types of goods and services traded, and the countries with which India conducts trade. The project could also involve examining the factors that influence India's trade patterns, such as economic conditions, government policies, and global market trends. The ultimate goal of the project could be to provide insights and recommendations on ways to improve India's trade performance and strengthen its position in the global economy.

A few questions that can be answered using this dataset are:

* What did India export the most in any given year?
* Which commodity forms a major chunk of trade? Does it conform to theories of international trade?
* How has the trade between India and any given country grown over time?
